# CNN-PCAM-Tumor-Classification

As part of my Deep Learning course at CentraleSup√©lec, I train a CNN on 10% of the [PCAM](https://github.com/basveeling/pcam?tab=readme-ov-file) dataset which consists of 32768 96x96px images from histopathology patches of lymph nodes. These images are labelled with a 0 (not containing any tumor tissue) and 1 (containing tumor tissue).
